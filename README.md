* **Javascript** - Javascript was used to update, filter, sort and create actions on the application.

* **SASS**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap5** - SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) takes the advantage of variables, maps, mixins, and functions to help build faster projects. Bootstrap includes a handful of Sass maps, key value pairs that make it easier to generate families of related CSS. SASS, CSS and Boostrap5 enabled this project to be responsive and also created the ability to create styling variables that can be used in different parts of the page.

_**Note**_: _In order to view the styling applied in this application, ensure you have SASS installed via node using_ `npm install --save node sass`. _This will compile your SASS into CSS after cloning the project_


## Features

* Filter a list of programs based on availability and delievery method
* Users also have the ability to clear all filters and return to page default
